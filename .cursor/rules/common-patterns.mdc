# Common Library Patterns

## Purpose

The common library provides shared types and utilities across all components.

## Key Modules

- [lib.rs](mdc:common/src/lib.rs) - Library entry point
- [api.rs](mdc:common/src/api.rs) - Shared API types and structures
- [crypto.rs](mdc:common/src/crypto.rs) - Cryptographic utilities

## Shared Types

- API request/response structures
- Cryptographic key types
- Common error types
- Serialization/deserialization helpers

## Dependencies

- `serde` for serialization
- `uuid` for unique identifiers
- `chrono` for timestamp handling

## Usage Pattern

All components depend on common:

```toml
common = { path = "../common" }
```

## Design Principles

- Keep dependencies minimal
- Focus on shared data structures
- Avoid business logic in common
- Use feature flags for optional functionality
