# VenomMonkey Project Structure

This is a Rust workspace containing a distributed multiplatform beacon system with three main components:

## Workspace Structure

- **agent/**: Cross-platform beacon agent that runs on target systems
- **client/**: CLI client for managing agents and executing commands
- **server/**: HTTP API server for agent management and job coordination
- **common/**: Shared types and utilities across all components

## Key Files

- [Cargo.toml](mdc:Cargo.toml) - Workspace configuration with release optimizations
- [Makefile](mdc:Makefile) - Build targets for all platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS)
- [Cross.toml](mdc:Cross.toml) - Cross-compilation configuration for embedded targets
- [Dockerfile](mdc:Dockerfile) - Container builds for different architectures

## Build System

- Uses `cargo` for local builds
- Uses `cross` for cross-compilation to multiple targets
- Uses `upx` for binary compression
- Supports native, Linux x86_64, Windows x86_64, and macOS aarch64 targets

## Architecture

- **Agent**: Daemonized service that beacons to server
- **Client**: CLI tool for agent management and command execution
- **Server**: REST API with PostgreSQL database for agent/job management
- **Common**: Shared cryptographic and API types
